Hello Team GDGOC!




Literally This Exercise Teaches me a lot from making sticky nav to animated cards,
 actually its takes more time bcz of my mistake once i read the task at that tym i made mistake to 
 read and when task is completed again iwas reading the needs then I realise i made another 
 one ( actully there is mantioned "each card includes an icon, servise name and description. call to actn btn " but the mistake 
 is i didn't notice "." between description and CTA btn , thats take more tym.)  

 Approach :

 To create a responsive service page with a sticky header that shrinks on scroll, use HTML & CSS.
 Design a visually appealing header with smooth transitions that adapts when scrolling. 
 Add flexible service cards with consistent spacing and responsive layouts. Include an engaging call-to-action banner 
 with hover effects for user interaction. Use JavaScript to detect scroll activity and dynamically adjust the header 
 size, ensuring an optimized user experience.

 learnings:

 position : sticky,fixed,static.
 min/max height,
 z-index,
 animation,
 transitions,
 @keyframes -- actully i learned previously, but never used  before.

 ThankYou!
